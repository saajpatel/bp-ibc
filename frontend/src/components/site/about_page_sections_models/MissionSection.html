        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>
            Our mission is to reduce unnecessary harm to wildlife by educating the public on when —
            and when not — to intervene. Many animals that appear abandoned or distressed are actu-
            ally behaving naturally. Through education and guidance, we help protect wildlife, their
            families, and the people trying to help them.
